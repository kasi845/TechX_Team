## Inspiration
We joined the Meta Horizon "Open Source Champions" competition to explore remixable worlds and share something simple for other creators.

## What it does
Our project is a **remixable world template** with reusable assets and a short tutorial. Anyone can clone, edit, and extend it.

## How we built it
- Horizon Worlds Creator tools
- Meta Horizon Creator Program (MHCP)
- Documentation and open-source sharing mindset

## What we learned
- Basics of remixable world building
- How to make interactive and shareable assets
- The importance of open-source collaboration

## Try it out
